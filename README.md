# jaffle_shop (fork)

## Setup

Define your python environment in an environment.yaml file. It can look something like this:

```yaml
name: dbt_jaffle_shop
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - pip
  - pip:
    - pyarrow
    - polars
    - duckdb
    - dbt-duckdb
    - ipykernel
    - jupyter
    - deltalake
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
```

Install the DuckDB adapter for dbt and other necessary dependencies by running the following mamba command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yaml
```

To update your environment, run the following mamba command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba env update --file environment.yaml --prune
```

To activate the environment, run the following mamba command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba activate dbt_jaffle_shop
```

## Instructions

Once your environment has been defined and you have used mamba (or conda) to create it and install the necessary packages, you can clone the jaffle_shop repo and run dbt commands against it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop.git
```

Change into the jaffle_shop directory from the command line:
```bash
cd jaffle_shop
```

Create a new dbt project by running this command in your terminal.

```bash
dbt init jaffle_shop
``````

In your dbt project directory, create a profiles.yml file. For example, to use DuckDB, your profiles.yml file should look like this:

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: duckdb
      path: '/Users/zacklarsen/Documents/Documents - Zackâ€™s Mac mini/Projects/jaffle_shop/jaffle_shop.duckdb'
      extensions:
        - httpfs
        - parquet
```

Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line:

```bash
dbt debug
```

Load the CSVs with the demo data set. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema. Note that a typical dbt project **does not require this step** since dbt assumes your raw data is already in your warehouse.

```bash
dbt seed
```

Run dbt run in your terminal to compile and run your dbt project. This will create a compiled SQL file for your example_model and execute it against your DuckDB database.

```bash
dbt run
```

> **NOTE:** If this steps fails, it might mean that you need to make small changes to the SQL in the models folder to adjust for the flavor of SQL of your target database. Definitely consider this if you are using a community-contributed adapter.

Test the output of the models:

```bash
dbt test
```

Generate documentation for the project:

```bash
dbt docs generate
```

View the documentation for the project:

```bash
dbt docs serve
```

Navigate to your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to view the documentation. Click on the lower right corner to view the data lineage graph for your project, which shows a DAG of the source tables and transformations.

## Query newly created tables from seeds using DuckDB:
```bash
duckdb

.open jaffle_shop.duckdb
```

In the duckdb session that opens, you can query the newly created tables by issuing SQL commands.:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
```

### What's in this repo?
This repo contains [seeds](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds) that includes some (fake) raw data from a fictional app.

The raw data consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the following entity-relationship diagram:
